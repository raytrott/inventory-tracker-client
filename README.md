# iGot Inventory Tracker

![iGot App Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Gj2IOHt.png)

This is the frontend repo for my full stack inventory tracker application, iGot! With iGot, a user can create and manage multiple inventory lists of anything and everything in their everyday life.

For this final capstone project from General Assembly, I wanted to focus on further honing my skills with React and get more practice with MERN stack applications. Going through a move at the time, I decided to create an inventory tracker, as I was already in the mindset of keeping track of the belongings I was packing, selling, and getting rid of. I hope to continue improving this app over time, so if you'd like to make contributions, please see the Installation section below!

## Project Planning

In preparation for work on this app, I created a wireframe, entity relationship diagram, and user stories which can be found below.

### User Stories
- As a user, I can create a new account.
- As a user, I can sign into my account.
- As a user, I can change my password while signed into my account.
- As a user, I can sign out of my account.
- As a user, I can create multiple inventories.
- As a user, I can create a new item and its quantity to add to my inventory.
- As a user, I can update the name and quantity of an existing item in my inventory.
- As a user, I can delete an item from my inventory.
- As a user, I can see a list of all my items in an inventory (e.g. utensils, paper towels, plates, etc).
- As a user, I can view a list of all my different inventories (e.g. e-store, home goods, party planning, etc).

## Areas For Development and Future Improvements

As the app exists currently, the UI leaves a lot to be desired. For future iterations, I want to focus on:
- improving styling for more of a branded look
- improving user message alerts to convey success or failure
- improving the inventory item display and edit features by putting them into editable tables
- adding the ability to add an item to a list easily
- routing and redirecting so as to provide users a seamless experience transitioning from index to individual lists
